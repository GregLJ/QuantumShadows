# Quantum Shadows

Created as the final project for IT-140 Intro to Scripting class at SNHU.

## Theme and Storyline:
The theme of Quantum Shadows is interdimensional travel and time manipulation. Players navigate through different dimensions that exist within the kingdom of Chronomoria, a realm where time and space are warped. The storyline involves the quantum sorcerer, Nexus Nocturne, who is a fallen time-keeper seduced by power. Nexus is tearing holes in reality, creating interdimensional portals. The player, a time-keeper, is chosen to restore order by gathering the shattered pieces of the quantum codex hidden in these dimensions.

## Rooms:
- **Start Room (Chronomoria Courtyard)**: This is where the player begins.
- **Solar Sanctuary**: A tranquil cathedral in an eternal sunset.
- **Temporal Tundra**: An icy landscape where time moves slower.
- **Clockwork Jungle**: A sprawling jungle of mechanical flora and fauna.
- **Echoing Abyss**: An empty void, where the unseen is revealed by sound.
- **Glass Labyrinth**: A maze of mirrors, reflecting endless realities.
- **Astral Atoll**: An Island floating in an astral sea.
- **Quantum Crypt**: The lair of the Quantum sorcerer.

## Items (Shards of the Quantum Codex):
- **Fragment of Continuum**: Located in the Solar Sanctuary.
- **Chrono Crystal**: Located in the Temporal Tundra.
- **Paradox Leaf**: Located in Clockwork Jungle.
- **Abyssal Echo**: Located in Echoing Abyss.
- **Mirror Shard**: Located in Glass Labyrinth.
- **Stellar Sand**: Located in Astral Atoll.

## Villain:
The Quantum Sorcerer, a time-keeper corrupted by power, who manipulates time and space. Players start at Chronomoria Courtyard and move North, South, East, or West to collect the items from each room. After collecting all items, they will face the Quantum Sorcerer in the Quantum Crypt. If they encounter the villain before collecting all items, they will be trapped in a time loop and the game will restart.
